                <p>SINGA means “connect” in Lingala, a language spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The first SINGA organisation was founded in 2012 in Paris. SINGA has won a number of awards and prizes for its innovative and inclusive programs and has managed to create a network of committed people worldwide. Since SINGA’s initial inception in Paris, a number of local SINGA organisations have been established across the world. While each organisation operates independently and responds to local needs and context,

                        SINGA stands for a clear set of inclusive values that are adhered to internationally. SINGA in Switzerland was founded in Zurich in December 2016. We are part of the international network of SINGA organisations across France, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the UK that regularly exchanges know-how, best-practices and tools. While the first and second cycle of the SINGA Factory took place in Zurich in 2017 and 2018, we have already engaged SINGA communities in Bern and Geneva, and are looking for more committed people to start SINGA projects all over Switzerland.
                        
                        Why did we start SINGA in Switzerland?
                        Switzerland is a highly diverse, multinational and multicultural country, where about one-third of the population has a migration background. As people from different backgrounds with diverse perspectives come together, so does the need for opportunities where people can exchange at eye level and with mutual respect. Once this happens, the combination of those diverse perspectives can spark fresh ideas and trigger innovation, taking us in unexpected and exciting directions. That is why we started SINGA in Switzerland. 
                        
                        People from refugee and migrant backgrounds have great potential to contribute, but this potential often goes unfulfilled in Switzerland. With our different programs we want to establish an environment where people from refugee and migrant backgrounds can participate in society and find the necessary network to build their life in Switzerland. We believe it is human connection that builds bridges and clears up misunderstandings, allowing people to learn from each other, to be inspired by each other, and to work together to build a truly inclusive society. </p>
